# youtube-word-finder

Web Application that can provide a video of any word being used in a sentence. Uses Node.js and Express.js to host the video results and communicate with the web scraper built using Python.

To run, navigate to the unzipped project folder in the terminal and run the command ``npm init -y`` and ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install all dependancies.
Use command ``node index.js`` to start the node js server on http://localhost:3000.

Results may take a couple minutes to load as the video scraper works in the background to search through hundreds of YouTube videos.
